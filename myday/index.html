<p>OMG, today was like, totally average but also kinda cool in its own way? Woke up with my alarm blaring at 7 AM, and I swear, it's the most annoying sound in the world. Hit snooze like, three times before I finally dragged myself out of bed. My hair was a complete disaster, and I had this weird dream about flying on a giant pizza slice. Yeah, don't ask.</p>

<p>Breakfast was the usual chaos. My little bro spilled his cereal all over the table, and mom was on a mission to make everyone eat something healthy. Ended up with toast and a banana because I was running late. Again.</p>

<p>School was school. Math first period is a crime against humanity. I mean, who can even function, let alone solve equations, that early in the morning? But the day got better cuz we had art class, and I'm working on this painting that's actually turning out pretty dope.</p>
